This application provides the means to map (crosswalk) data specifications (standards) using predefined sets of mapping predicates that indicate the degree of equivalency between mapped property pairs, or the lack of such equivalency. The mapping outcomes of the tool will support data interoperability between data specifications based on the probabilities of matching or closely matching semantics.

## Local installation 1 (docker)

> Precondition -> The following technolgoes are needed before starting the installation:
> - docker
> - docker compose

2. Create an ".env" file by copying the ".env.example" file. (It can be modified before the docker images are created)
3. Execute `docker compose build`
4. Execute `docker compose up`
5. In a different command prompt, execute `docker compose run --rm web rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`
6. Go to http://localhost:3000

## Local installation 2

> Precondition -> The following technilogies are needed before starting the installation:
> - ruby 2.7.1
> - postgreSQL 13
> - npm
> - node
> - yarn

1. Clone this project locally.
2. Create an ".env" file by copying the ".env.example" file.
3. Make sure the version of ruby on your system is the same as declared in the Gemfile.
4. Run `bundle install` (backend dependencies).
5. Run `yarn install` (frontend dependencies).
